# Explainable Domain Specific Large Language Models: A Law Case Study

![Final Architecture](https://github.com/majidghassemi/LawKG-ML-23-FP/blob/master/Final%20Architecture.svg)

## Overview
This project introduces a pioneering framework for a question-answering system, leveraging a knowledge graph (KG) extracted from the corpus of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) proceedings. It aims to enhance understanding and navigation of complex legal documents.

## Project Structure
- **implementation**: This contains the full implementation of the system instance, showcasing the practical application of the framework.
- **evaluation**: Here, various semantic evaluation methodologies are provided, demonstrating the effectiveness and accuracy of the model.
- **evaluation_helpers**: Contains scripts used for generating evaluation answers from the model, crucial for validating the system's performance.
- **kg_creation**: Includes scripts for creating a nested knowledge graph, along with methods for uploading it to a Neo4j database, ensuring a robust and interconnected data structure.
- **scripts/**: Offers a collection of helper scripts for ontology. The ontology approach is heavily inspired by [AnjaneyaTripathi's knowledge_graph](https://github.com/AnjaneyaTripathi/knowledge_graph).
